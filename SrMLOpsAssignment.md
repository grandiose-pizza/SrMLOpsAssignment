# Sr. MLOps Engineer Assignment

## Introduction
This assignment is designed to assess your skills and proficiency in MLOps practices, particularly in Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud services. You will be tasked with both hands-on practical tasks and theoretical questions to demonstrate your understanding and expertise.

## Objectives
- Set up a Kubernetes cluster and deploy a simple application.
- Containerize an application using Docker.
- Create a CI/CD pipeline for the automated deployment of the application.
- Deploy the application to a cloud service of your choice.

## Practical Tasks
1. **Kubernetes Cluster Setup**
   - Initialize a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine or using a cloud provider.
   - Deploy a sample web application to the cluster.
   - Ensure the application is accessible via an external IP address.

2. **Dockerization**
   - Create a Dockerfile for a sample web application.
   - Build the Docker image and push it to a public container registry.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
   - The pipeline should automate the testing, building, and deployment of the Dockerized application to the Kubernetes cluster.

4. **Cloud Deployment**
   - Deploy the application to a cloud service (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.).
   - Provide documentation on how the application can be accessed and any credentials needed.

## Theoretical Questions
Please provide answers to the following questions:
1. What are the benefits of using a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes?
2. How does a CI/CD pipeline improve the software development process?
3. What considerations should be taken into account when deploying an application to the cloud?

## Deliverables
- A GitHub repository containing:
  - The Kubernetes configuration files.
  - The Dockerfile and any scripts used to build and push the Docker image.
  - The CI/CD pipeline configuration files.
  - A `README.md` documenting the steps taken and how to access the deployed application.
- A report answering the theoretical questions.

## Submission
Please submit your GitHub repository link and report via email to [Insert Contact Email Here] by the end of the next business day following the receipt of this assignment.

Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your work!
